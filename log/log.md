## Asset Pricing Measurement:
The proposal focuses on the change in implied volatility. This is fine, but you should also consider alternative measures such as estimating the anticipated price jump or incorporating risk information, following the methodologies outlined in Barth and So (2014) and Smith and So (2021). The reason is that you are not looking at the market as a whole, but rather individual companies, so these alternative measures would provide a better understanding of the firm-specific anticipated market response to election outcomes.

## Exposure Measurement:
The proposal raises a concern regarding the relevance of the firm’s headquarters as an indicator of exposure. While using utilities aligns well with headquarters and operational locations, expanding beyond utilities may pose challenges in accurately measuring exposure.

## Scaling Up:
Based on the potential observed in the research proposal, scaling up the analysis is encouraged. This can be achieved by incorporating more elections and expanding beyond utilities, as discussed earlier. Collecting additional data on options would be necessary for this expansion. The required information is readily available, you just need to get access to appropriate sources.

## Statistical Analysis:
The research proposal presents a well-designed test with a focused treatment "window" and intent-to-treat approach, indicating local exposure. In my opinion, couching the analysis in the terms of regression discontinuity and difference-in-differences frameworks may not be necessary and could potentially distract from the main findings. For example, I don’t understand why the pattern in Figure 4 is problematic. I think that Figure 5, on the other hand, is quite clear and convincing.

## Exposure Measurement:
Hassan et al 2017 uses conference call transcripts to measure political risk/uncertainty at the firm level. Maybe we can use the same data to examine firm exposure to regional politics. For example, if firm A cares a lot about local political decisions/policies in state X, then an uncertain election in state X should have implications on the firm's implied volatility. This way we can intuitively look at how investors and managers themselves think about the firm's exposure to different layers of risk and uncertainty
